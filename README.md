# Python Function Order System

A Python-based order processing system that demonstrates the use of functions, `if-elif` statements, and user input handling to efficiently manage and customize orders. This project showcases how conditional logic and functions can be utilized to automate business processes in a streamlined way.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to select options for their order (e.g., type of item, size, etc.).
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices are automatically calculated based on the selected options.
- **Order Confirmation**: Users are prompted to confirm their order and provide delivery details.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully with appropriate messages.

## How It Works

The system uses functions to manage the flow of the program and conditionals (`if-elif` statements) to ensure the correct options are selected and the correct price is displayed.

### Example Workflow:

1. The user is prompted to select an item and its size.
2. The program calculates the price based on the chosen options.
3. The user confirms their order, providing delivery details.
4. The order is processed, or the user can cancel at any time.

## Technologies Used

- Python (for logic and functions)
- Basic input-output handling
